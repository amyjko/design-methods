		<h1>What designers do</h1>
		<div class="lead">Andrew J. Ko</div>
		
		<p>When I was an undergraduate, I didn't have a clue about design. Like most students in technical fields, I thought design was about colors, fonts, layout, and other low-level visual details. I knew enough about user interfaces to know that design <em>mattered</em>, I just didn't know how much or why.</p>
		
		<p>Then I went to grad school to get a Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon's <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu">Human-Computer Interaction Institute</a>, where I studied not only computer science and behavioral sciences, but design as well, combining these fields together into my expertise in Human-Computer Interaction. Suddenly I was surrounded by designers, and taking <a href="http://design.cmu.edu">design classes</a> with design students in design studios. Quickly I learned that design was much, much more than what was visible. Design was where ideas came from. It was processes for generating ideas. It was methods for evaluating ideas. It was ways of communicating ideas. I learned that design was <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02300500">problem solving</a>, and that it was the problem solving that shapes the world. After all, look around you: nearly everything in the space you're reading this in is designed by someone, somewhere, to solve some problem. As this XKCD comic illustrates, once you realize the designed world around you, it's hard not to see the design <i>work</i> behind everything around you:</p>

		<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/1741/"><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/work.png" class="img-responsive center-block" /></a></p>

		<p>After some time, I also realized that if design was problem solving, then we all design to some degree. When you rearrange your room to better access your clothes, you're doing interior design. When you create a sign to remind your roommates about their chores, you're doing information design. When you make a poster or a sign for a club, you're doing graphic design. We may not do any of these things particularly well or with great expertise, but each of these is a design enterprise that has the <em>capacity</em> for expertise and skill.</p>
		
		<p>What does it mean to do design professionally then? In the context of information, design is everywhere, particularly in the software industry. Consider all of the job titles that have a little (or a lot) of design embedded in them:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><b>Graphic designers</b> take information and find ways to present it in a way that efficiently engages people in understanding that information. As a grad student, I took several graphic design courses and learned just how hard this is to do (not the least of which because the Adobe Creative Suite has such a steep learning curve).</li>
			<li><b>Interaction designers</b> envision new kinds of interactions with interactive technologies, usually as part of design consultancies. They usually work on contract, helping other companies envision new products.</li>
			<li><b>Product designers/managers</b> investigate market opportunities and technical opportunities and design products that capitalize on those opportunities in a competitive landscape. The person that envisioned <a href="http://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>? A product designer. Mark Zuckerburg when he envisioned Facebook with the help of his investors and co-founders? A product designer.</a></li>
			<li><b>Software engineers</b> do many kinds of design. They design data structures, algorithms, and software architectures. Front end developers occasionally design user interfaces, unless they work in an organization that has dedicated user interface designers.</li>
			<li><b>User experience designers</b> design and prototype user interfaces, defining the functionality, flow, layout, and overarching experiences that are possible in a product. In many bigger companies, UX designers determine what software engineers build.</li>
			<li><b>User experience researchers</b> understand problems deeply so that designers can envision solutions to those problems or improve existing products.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>In my experience, design is where the <em>power</em> is in companies. Designers determine what companies make, and that determines what people use. But people with the word "design" in their job title don't necessarily possess this power. For example, in one company, graphic designers may just be responsible for designing icons, whereas in another company, they might envision a whole user experience. In contrast, many people <i>without</i> the word design in their title have immense design power. For example, some CEOs like Steve Jobs exercised considerable design power over products, meaning that other designers were actually beholden to his judgement. In other companies (some parts of Microsoft, for example), design power is often distributed to lower-level designers within the company.</p>

		<p>What is it that all of these roles have in common? In my experience, they all involve these skills:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Seeking <b>multiple perspectives</b> on a problem (sometimes conflicting ones). There's no better way to understand what's actually happening in the world than to view it from as many other perspectives as you can.</li>
			<li><b>Divergent thinking</b>. This is the ability to creatively envision new possibilities. When designers consider alternatives in <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1879836">parallel</a>, they design better things.</li>
			<li><b>Convergent thinking</b>. This is the ability to take a wide range of possibilities and <em>choose</em> one using all of the evidence, insight, and intuition you have.</li>
			<li><b>Exploiting failure</b>. Most people avoid and hide failure; designers learn from it, because behind every bad idea is a reason for it's failure that should be understood and integrated into your understanding of a problem.</li>
			<li><b>Externalizing ideas</b> as sketches, prototypes, writing, and other forms. By doing this, designers express details, often revealing which parts of an idea are still ill- or undefined.</li>
			<li>Maintaining <b>emotional distance</b> from ideas. If you're too attached with an idea, you might not see or accept a better one that you or someone else discovers.</li>
			<li><b>Seeking critique</b>. No one has enough perspective or knowledge to know everything good and bad about design on their own. Seeking the perspective of others on an idea helps complete this picture.</li>
			<li><b>Justifying decisions</b>. No design is acceptable to everyone. Designers must be able to justify a choice, compare it to alternative choices, and explain why the choice they made is the "best" choice relative to the tradeoffs.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>In a way, all of these skills are fundamentally about <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1357156">empathy</a> skills, because they all require a designer to see problems and solutions from other people's perspectives, whether these people are users, other designers, or people in other roles, such as marketers, engineers, project managers, etc.</p>

		<p>I believe these skills can be learned. (If I didn't, I wouldn't be a very good design teacher!). How then does one learn all of these skills and get one of those jobs I listed above?</p>
		
		<p>Practice. And specifically, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0033-295X.100.3.363">deliberate practice</a>. You must design <em>a lot</em> and get <em>a lot</em> of feedback about your designs. Choose a medium to design in (you're Informatics students: I'd recommend web, mobile, databases, VR, AR, and other information media over things like fashion design or bridge design) and start practicing! We'll spend much of this class learning <em>how</em> to practice and <em>what</em> to practice.</p>
