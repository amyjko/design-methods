		<h1>How to design for markets</h1>
		<div class="lead">Amy J. Ko</div>

		<p>For the vast majority of our time in the class, we've focused on something called "blue sky" design. This is a design context where you can choose any problem and be truly free to devise a solution that you think best addresses a problem. This kind of design can be incredibly enriching and quite challenging because a designer must constantly self-impose constraints to scope and focus their design efforts.</p>
		
		<p>Most of the design in the world is <em>not</em> blue sky design. In fact, it's quite the opposite: most design is <em>over-constrained</em> with so many external requirements that the space of possible problems and solutions is so narrow, the challenge is not scoping your design efforts, but rather creatively finding solutions within constraints. These over-constrained design settings most typically occur in business settings, where you need to not only design a solution, but a <em>product</em> that can make a company a profit.</p>
		
		<p>To give you a sense of what highly constrained design settings feel like, let's discuss a few examples of design projects and how design was interleaved through other challenges.</p>
		
		<h2>Google</h2>
	
		<p><img src="images/google-founders.png" class="img-responsive pull-left" style="margin-right: 1em">Google began in March 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Ph.D. students at Stanford working on the Stanford Digital Library Project (SDLP). The SDLP's goal was "to develop the enabling technologies for a single, integrated and universal digital library." and was funded through the National Science Foundation among other federal agencies.</p>
		
		<p>In search for a dissertation theme, Page considered&mdash;among other things&mdash;exploring the mathematical properties of the World Wide Web, understanding its link structure as a huge graph. His supervisor Terry Winograd encouraged him to pick this idea (which Page later recalled as "the best advice I ever got") and Page focused on the problem of finding out which web pages link to a given page, considering the number and nature of such backlinks to be valuable information about that page (with the role of citations in academic publishing in mind).</p>
		
		<p>Page's web crawler began exploring the web in March 1996, setting out from Page's own Stanford home page as its only starting point.
Originally the search engine used the Stanford website with the domain google.stanford.edu. The domain google.com was registered on September 15, 1997. They formally incorporated their company, Google Inc., on September 4, 1998 at a friend's garage in Menlo Park, California.</p>

		<hr>

		<p>Now, reflect on this story a bit. Where was design in any of this? At the time, there were dozens of search engines and Google's user experience design was really not dramatically different. In fact, it was far less capable than all of the other products at the time. The only thing that was new was a better algorithm for retrieving results. In fact, close friends who worked for Google when it was founded tell stories about how the founders never really thought there would ever be enough design work for Google to need more than a part time designer. Of course, that isn't true any more&mdash;the company has thousands of designers now&mdash;but their design efforts on their search page are still extremely focused and narrow incremental improvements.</p>

		<p>So what is it like to design for the Google Search team? It's not about complete redesigns. It's about preserving a design that exists, getting its details consistent across platforms, and fighting the urge to break its simplicity. The designers job in this context is to <em>not</em> design, but to preserve simplicity.</p>
		
		<h2>The iPod</h2>
		
		<p><img src="images/fadell.png" class="img-responsive pull-left" style="margin-right: 1em">Do you know where the iPod came from? It wasn't Apple. It was actually a former employee of General Magic and Philips named Tony Fadell. He had a vision for a brand new MP3 player. Unlike the bulky flash memory-based MP3 players from Rio and other companies that existed at the time, Fadell wanted to deliver a small hard drive-based player that was linked with a content delivery system where users could legally obtain and download music. This was a design idea he'd conceived of across several years of working in consumer electronics, but hadn't found a chance to pursue.</p>
		
		<p>In 2000, he went searching for a company that would help him make his vision a reality. The first company he pitched it to was RealNetworks (in 2000), where the CEO, Rob Glaser, was already in control of a large content delivery system through Real's premium radio and television channels. Real could not rationalize going through the trouble of releasing an accessory to their already profitable system, so they would be caught off guard when the iTunes Music Store was opened. Fadell also approached Phillips, which also rebuffed him.</p>
		
		<p>Out of desperation, Fadell turned to Apple, which years before had sworn off consumer electronics after their unsuccessful Pippin and Newton. The executives at Apple were very enthusiastic about implementing Fadell's plan at Apple - unbeknownst to Fadell, Apple had bought the rights to SoundJam MP months before, which would eventually become iTunes. Tony was hired in early 2001 and was given a development team of around thirty people and a deadline of one year to release a successful product.</p>
		
		<p>Fadell was not confident that Apple would fund (or even complete) the development of custom hardware and software for the player, so he shopped around for an existing software player to use as the basis of the Apple player. After briefly looking at Rio and Creative, the team found PortalPlayer, a new company that had not yet released a full product. PortalPlayer was assisting other companies to develop MP3 players based on common software. Before Apple approached them, their most promising customer was IBM, which was working on a black, flash memory-based player that had a Bluetooth headphone system. The executives at PortalPlayer did not like the chances of IBM releasing a consumer MP3 player, so they jumped at Apple's offer to design their player's software exclusively.</p>
		
		<p>Steve Jobs took a very active role in the project, scheduling frequent meetings with the directors from Fadell's group and PortalPlayer. During these meetings he would tell them in detail what issues he had with the device, whether it was the interface, sound quality, or the size of the scroll wheel. This was rare for an Apple project at the time, and it reassured the leaders in the group that the project would not be axed immediately.</p>
		
		<p>In the span of eight months, Fadell's team and PortalPlayer dedicated all of their energies to finishing the iPod. In three months, Apple had created a preliminary version of the user interface and scroll wheel that would ship with the finished iPod.</p>
		
		<hr>
		
		<p>Compare this design "process" to the design processes we've discussed in this class, and to the constraints at Google. What's different? Tony already had a vision, but no prototype. He spent most of his time seeking partners that would invest in prototyping, and couldn't really get started until he had a partner. He had to find the company with <em>just</em> the right risk profile (having the resources to fail, taking a big risk on a new market, investing in not just hardware but software too). Only after all of these resources were in place did they begin prototyping, iterating, and testing, and even then, all of that was in the span of just three months, and constrained to the music player and hardware user interface that Apple had already bought. The range of possible designs for the iPod was actually quite narrow given the time and existing products that Apple had purchased. Again, this was not blue sky design, but highly constrained, rapid prototyping.</p>

		<h2>Facebook</h2>
		
		<p><img src="images/zuckerburg.png" class="img-responsive pull-left" style="margin-right: 1em">Before Facebook, there were hundreds of kinds of social media platforms already floating around the web. MySpace was the big one, along with dozens of other ways of creating online profiles and friends lists. Virtually none of the functionality in Facebook's early prototypes was new. So where did it come from?</p>
		
		<p><img src="images/facemash.png" class="img-responsive pull-right" style="margin-right: 1em">Harvard didn't offer a student directory with photos and basic information, known at most schools as a face book. Zuckerberg wanted to build an online version for Harvard, but the school "kept on saying that there were all these reasons why they couldn't aggregate this information," he says. "I just wanted to show that it could be done." So one night early in his sophomore year, he hacked into Harvard's student records. He then threw up a basic site called Facemash, which randomly paired photos of undergraduates and invited visitors to determine which one was "hotter" (not unlike the Web site Hot or Not). Four hours, 450 visitors, and 22,000 photo views later, Harvard yanked Zuckerberg's Internet connection.</p>
		
		<p>After a dressing-down from the administration and an uproar on campus chronicled by The Harvard Crimson, Zuckerberg politely apologized to his fellow students. But he remained convinced he'd done the right thing: "I thought that the information should be available." In February 2004 Mr Zuckerberg launched "The facebook", as it was originally known; the name taken from the sheets of paper distributed to freshmen, profiling students and staff. Within 24 hours, 1,200 Harvard students had signed up, and after one month, over half of the undergraduate population had a profile.</p>
		
		<hr>
		
		<p>How would you characterize this design process relative to the ones above and the blue sky methods that we've discussed in class? In a way, Mark practiced a form of human-centered design, trying to bring information about social networks at Harvard to the student population in a way that wasn't accessible via other forms of social media. That original idea&mdash;of modeling the network at schools and universities&mdash; was actually the business's growth model, focusing on schools as an untapped market. It's not that MySpace wouldn't have worked for this purpose, but that it wasn't <em>optimized</em> for this purpose. The design work that the early Facebook team did was to conceive of a visual language and brand that attracted students in ways that MySpace wasn't. In this way, Facebook was a highly incremental product, building upon all of the ideas that came before it with a dramatically different visual design and model for growth.</p>
		
		<h2>Design, markets, and products</h2>
		
		<p>What underlies all of these stories about the role of design in business are a few key concepts:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><b>Design</b> is problem solving under constraints.</li>
			<li><b>Markets</b> are a source of constraints.</li>
			<li><b>Products</b> are designs that satisfy market constraints.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Therefore, as much as we've talked about what <em>design</em> entails in this class, we've actually talked very little about design under <em>constraints</em> and even less about the particular kinds of constraints that arise in business.</p>
		
		<p>One theory that is helpful in thinking about market constraints is called <b>Diffusion of Innovation Theory</b>. In essence, it predicts that the most adoptable innovations have the following properties:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>High relative advantage compared to available solutions</li>
			<li>Compatible with existing systems and workflows</li>
			<li>Low complexity and learning curve</li>
			<li>Easily tried</li>
			<li>Easily repurposed for many uses</li>
			<li>Observable value</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>These are the major constraints imposed by markets.</p>
		
		<p>What does this mean for your role as a designer in a marketplace? It means your job won't only be to conceive of great solutions to problems, but also to find solutions that are highly adoptable, per the factors above. And that might mean designing <em>less</em> innovative, <em>more</em> incremental things, as those are easier to learn, easier to try, and more compatible.</p>
